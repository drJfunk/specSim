Purpose: Simulate GBM TTE data via the GBM DRMs 
Requirements: Astropy, Numpy, Numba, Scipy


This tool kit allows for the simulation of GBM TTE data by folding a 
an evolving spectral model throught the GBM DRMs. The spectral model
is a user defined fucntion that returns a photon flux (phts/s/cm2) for
given time (sec) and energy (keV).

An example of the such a function:


def evo(ene, t):

    val = 10. * ene**(-2*t)

    return val


Here a power law in photon flux with a decaying power law index is defined
by the user and will be convertered to GBM TTE data.

The other user defined inputs to a simulation are the demonstrated and explianed:


bkgTime = [-10.,20.]  The start and stop times of the simulated background

sourceTime = [0.,16.] The start and stop times of the simulated source

bkgParams = [300,-1.5] The amplitude and power law index of the background spectrum

bn = "130427324" The GBM burst number corresponding the DRMs used for the simulation

ext = "130427A/" Optionial extension for the DRMs to be read from and the TTE to be stored

simDets = ["n6","na","b1"] The detectors to be simulated

emin = 8. Minimum energy of the simulated spectrum

emax = 50000. Maximum energy of the simulated spectrum


Once these parameters are defined the must be set through the various Set() methods
of the main class, simBuilder.
